ðŸŽ“ excited to share my latest project: Kindle PDF Annotator! 

As an academic, I was always frustrated with PDF annotation workflows. I love using my Kindle to read and highlight research papers, but the annotations get stored separately - couldn't share annotated PDFs with colleagues or import them into Zotero. 

So I built a tool that extracts Kindle annotations and embeds them directly back into the original PDFs with pixel-perfect accuracy! ðŸ“šâœ¨

No more juggling between separate annotation files - your highlights and notes finally live in the PDF where they belong. Works with Kindle Paperwhite 6th gen (haven't tested on newer ones yet).

Check it out on GitHub if you're also tired of disconnected annotation workflows! #AcademicLife #ProductivityTools #Python #OpenSource
