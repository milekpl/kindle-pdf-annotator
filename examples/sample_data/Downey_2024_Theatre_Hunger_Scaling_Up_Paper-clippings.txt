Accordingly, though linguistic skill may be much more sophisticated than that of perception, it is nevertheless still a skill exemplifying of no representational components [Bruineberg et al., 2019; Di Paolo et al., 2018; Kiverstein & Rietveld, 2018; Kiverstein & Rietveld, 2021; Noë, 2015

. It might prima facie appear that dreams demand a representational explanation. For one, it looks like dreams misrepresent the nature of one’s environment in a quite straightforward way— one experiences the presence of non-existent objects

Put shorter, whilst it is true that there is no (in)correct way to dream, what one’s dreams say about the world— by virtue of standing-in for it— does admit of correctness conditions.

To borrow the terminology used by Melanie Rosen in her systematic, empirically driven critique of SE accounts of dreaming in this vein, dreaming is inactive, not enactive [2018].

To distinguish this representation hunger from its more linguistically loaded cousin, I propose the label “theatre hunger” to refer to it: non-perceptual experiences hunger for the positing of a private, internal mental space— a Cartesian Theatre [Dennett, 1993]— within which objects, people, and states of aﬀairs are (mis)represented by mechanisms which function to stand-in for them.

The standing-in for functional role, unlike that of causal covariation, is often considered inextricably intertwined with representation because it looks to come concomitant with the possibility of misrepresentation. Consider in this vein a map of a city’s bus route network. That the map serves as a stand-in for the routes taken by buses makes it look almost inexorably subject to correctness conditions— it will be (in)accurate to varying degrees, depending upon the extent to which the bus route network that it stands-in for is as the map depicts it. Standing-in for therefore looks to naturally invoke and/or accommodate correctness conditions, and so the possibility of (mis) representing, in a way that causal covariation does not. It is likely for this reason that Haugeland’s understanding of representation in terms of standing-in for enjoys widespread acceptance in the philosophy of cognitive science and is regularly drawn upon in the waging of representation war (e.g. [Clark & Toribio, 1994, pp. 404–405; Orlandi, 2015, p. 9; Rowlands, 2017, p. 4221; van Gelder, 1995, p. 351]). Going beyond the case of Haugeland, it is common to see theorists endorsing an account
