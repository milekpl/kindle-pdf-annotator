# Test Summary

## All Tests Passing ✅

The complete pipeline has been tested and verified for all functionality.

### Test Results

| Test | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| test_integration_end_to_end.py | ✅ PASS | Complete pipeline: KRDS → Annotations → Annotated PDF |
| test_peirce_text_coverage.py | ✅ PASS | Text coverage validation (100% for all datasets) |
| test_highlight_positions.py | ✅ PASS | Position verification (all within bounds) |
| Bookmark Processing | ✅ PASS | PDF outline bookmarks correctly created |

**Total: 19 highlights + 2 bookmarks correctly processed across 3 PDFs**

### Coverage by Dataset

| Dataset | Highlights | Bookmarks | Notes | Status |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-------|--------|
| peirce-charles-fixation-belief | 8 | 2 | 2 | ✅ 100% |
| Downey_2024_Theatre_Hunger_Scaling_Up_Paper | 7 | 0 | 0 | ✅ 100% |
| 659ec7697e419 | 4 | 0 | 0 | ✅ 100% |

### Output Files

All annotated PDFs are generated in `tests/output/`:

1. `peirce-charles-fixation-belief_integrated.pdf` (60 KB) - 8 highlights, 2 bookmarks, 2 notes
2. `Downey_2024_Theatre_Hunger_Scaling_Up_Paper_integrated.pdf` (849 KB) - 7 highlights
3. `659ec7697e419_integrated.pdf` (226 KB) - 4 highlights

### Quality Verification

✅ All highlights are within page bounds  
✅ All highlights correctly match expected text locations  
✅ All bookmarks appear in PDF table of contents (outline)  
✅ All notes are created as PDF text annotations  
✅ Text-based matching successfully handles:
- Multi-line highlights
- Text normalization (e.g., "ch.4" → "ch. 4")
- Complex PDF filenames with cdeKey patterns
- Multiple document types and layouts
- Ligature fixes (ﬁ → fi, ﬂ → fl)

### Annotation Types Supported

1. **Highlights**: Yellow visual markers using text-based matching with PyMuPDF quads
2. **Notes**: Text annotations with popup comments
3. **Bookmarks**: PDF outline entries for navigation (visible in PDF readers' bookmark panel)

### Test Files

- **Integration Test**: `tests/test_integration_end_to_end.py`
- **Text Coverage Test**: `tests/test_peirce_text_coverage.py`
- **Position Verification Test**: `tests/test_highlight_positions.py`
- **Test Runner**: `tests/run_all_tests.py`

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python3 tests/run_all_tests.py

# Run individual tests
python3 tests/test_integration_end_to_end.py
python3 tests/test_peirce_text_coverage.py
python3 tests/test_highlight_positions.py
```

### Key Improvements Implemented

1. **Text-Based Matching**: Primary strategy uses PyMuPDF's `search_for()` with quads for precise character-level positioning
2. **Text Normalization**: Handles formatting differences (ligatures, abbreviations, spacing)
3. **PDF Path Finding**: Supports complex filenames with glob pattern matching
4. **Quality Verification**: Automated checks ensure highlights are within page bounds and correctly positioned
5. **Overlap Validation**: Test validates highlights by checking ≥80% overlap with expected text locations
6. **Bookmark Support**: Bookmarks are properly processed and added to PDF outline/table of contents
7. **Note Support**: Notes are created as text annotations at correct positions

### Success Criteria Met

✅ Unit tests pass (100% coverage for all datasets)  
✅ Highlights positioned at correct text locations  
✅ All highlights within page boundaries  
✅ Text-based matching works reliably across different PDF formats  
✅ End-to-end pipeline produces valid annotated PDFs  
✅ Bookmarks appear in PDF outline/navigation  
✅ Notes are correctly positioned
